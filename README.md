MyProject1: Interactive Event Analytics Dashboard
This repository contains the work from my final-year Master's in Business Analytics internship, 
where I designed and implemented an interactive, user-friendly dashboard using Looker Studio.

The core objectives of this project were:

-> To establish a reliable and accurate source of truth for all event-related data.
-> To facilitate prompt post-event analysis, with comprehensive reports delivered within
   two weeks of an event's conclusion.
-> To significantly improve the stakeholder experience by offering clear, actionable performance metrics to vendors, 
    sponsors, and event organizers, thereby supporting data-driven strategic planning.
